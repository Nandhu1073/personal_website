        <p>An in-depth understanding of networking is required to start a career in cybersecurity. Learning networking
          will help you understand data transmission's technical aspects, which will help you secure your data. Taking
          up networking certifications like CompTIA Security+ and Cisco CCNA is advisable.
          Another skill that will be beneficial for you is to master system administration. It is all about configuring
          and maintaining computers. You must be curious to know every aspect of your computer features and settings and
          play around a bit. </p>

        <h3>Network Security Control</h3>
        <img cla src="images/favicon-modified.png" alt="">
        <p>Network Security Control refers to the different measures which are employed to enhance the security of a
          network. You need to know how your network works, how routers, firewalls, and other devices work. A firewall
          is a hardware or software that blocks outgoing or incoming traffic from the internet to your computer. As a
          cybersecurity expert, you must leverage a firewall to filter and prevent unauthorized traffic onto the
          network.</p>
